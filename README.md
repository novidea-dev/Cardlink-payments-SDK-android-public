It aims to provide your customers with a smooth and secure transaction experience, while also offering developers a straightforward integration process.
Also, it enables users to conveniently store their credit cards on secure Cardlink servers, allowing for seamless reuse without re-entering card information multiple times. As the cards are never retained on the user's device and encrypted card data is transmitted to the server only once, the SDK delivers heightened security while simultaneously enhancing user experience.

## Requirements
Android API 26+

## Installation via Gradle
Add repository
```groovy
maven { url "https://maven.pkg.github.com/novidea-dev/Cardlink-payments-SDK-android-public" }
```

Add dependency to `build.gradle`:
```groovy
implementation "gr.cardlink.payments:payments-sdk:1.x"
```

## Usage
Follow these steps to start processing payments with Cardlink Android Payments SDK:

```kotlin
class App : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        PaymentsSdk.init(
            appContext = this,
            baseUrl = "https://baseUrl/",
            // optional headers param
            headers = mapOf(
                "Authorization" to "Bearer YourAuthToken",
                "Cookie" to "key=value"
            )
        )
    }
}
```

There is a convenient function `PaymentsSdk.newIntent()` that accepts as parameter a `PaymentRequest` object and launches the payment flow.

```kotlin 
data class PaymentRequest(
    // Total amount in the smallest currency unit (eg. cents) 
    val paymentTotalCents: Long, 
    // Currency code (eg. EUR), or number (eg. 971) 
    val currencyCode: String,
    // Purchace description 
    val description: String, 
    // Address line 
    val addressLine: String,
    // City 
    val city: String,
    // Country code (eg. GR) or number (eg. 370) 
    val countryCode: String, 
    // Zip/postal code 
    val postalCode: String,
    // Recurring frequency
    val recurringFrequency: Int? = null,
    // Recurring end date with format YYYYMMDD. This is mandatory if recurringFrequency is present.
    val recurringEndDate: String? = null
)
```

Start activity for result. SDK will post back, with key `PaymentActivity.KEY_PAYMENT_RESPONSE`, the following response:

```kotlin 
data class PaymentResponse( 
    val orderId: String?, 
    val transactionId: String?, 
    val errorCode: String?, 
    val description: String?, 
    val orderAmount: String?, 
    val paymentTotal: String?, 
    val currency: String?, 
    val paymentReference: String? 
) 
```

            paymentResponse?.let { 
                // do something with response
            }
        }

private fun makePayment() {
    val paymentRequest = PaymentRequest(/* request params */)
    val intent = PaymentsSdk.newIntent(this, paymentRequest)
    activityResultLauncher.launch(intent)
}
```

## Currency
### Specifying amounts
Currency amounts should be provided via the amount parameter as positive integers, representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (eg. 100 cents to charge €1.00, or 50050 cents to charge €500.50).

### Specifying code/number
The three-letter currency code, as defined by ISO-4217, of the transaction, such as "EUR" for Euros, or the respective number "978".

## Recurring payments
### Recurring frequency
Indicates the frequency of recurring payments and defines the minimum number of days between two subsequent payments. 28 is special value indicating that transactions are to be initiated on monthly basis. Max value is 30.

### Recurring end date
Recurring end date with format YYYYMMDD. This is mandatory if recurring frequency is present.
